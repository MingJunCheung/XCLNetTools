### Introduction

.net (C#) common class library DLL (maintained since 2012), now open source.Most of the code for this kind of library is written or collected by me. Ever since I started working, I have been hoping that there would be a common code base, which would be convenient for us to solve some highly repetitive and meaningless things in the coding process, so that we could devote more energy to other important things.So, I set up this public library in early 2012, put it on the native, and today, I'm publishing the code on GitHub, and I hope that good partners can help put their own efforts into saving more things for the average mass coder, including yourself.Thank you very much!
